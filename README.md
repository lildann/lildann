## About

I am a creative and organised full-stack developer. In November 2021 I graduated from [Makers Academy](#projects) software engineering bootcamp. My background and career up until now has been focused on contemporary art. Always seeking to look at the world in new ways, collaborate, and learn from my peers, I've planned and produced large-scale exhibitions in art galleries and museums in Berlin, New York, and London.

As an outcome of the pandemic, the art world moved online - intriguingly, most of this output sought only to reproduce the basic experience of viewing art through a screen. I was interested in how this could be developed, and the world of tech opened up through my research. Driven by curiosity, possibility, and a desire to keep learning, coding has changed my focus, widened my perspective, and enabled me to switch from a facilitator to a maker.

The skills I developed while building exhibitions - problem-solving, working to hard deadlines, and communicating across multiple departments - paired with a habit of analysing structures to make them more efficient, are qualities that I bring to a team with energy and positivity. Motivated by the impact code can make on everyday life, I'm excited to work in an industry that can create solutions to the complex problems we currently face.


## Projects

The Makers course focused on pair programming, test driven development, Agile processes, and learning by doing. You can see my progression throughout the course on [Github](https://github.com/lildann?tab=repositories), but here are a few projects to demonstrate what I learnt:

| Project                      | Description       | Timeframe         | Tech |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------|
| **[KickAbout](https://github.com/lildann/kickabout)** | A webapp designed to make organising and playing football games more accessible to everyone outside of its traditional audience. | 10-day final project in a group of 4 | Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, HTML, SASS |

| **[Takeaway](https://github.com/lildann/takeaway-challenge)**| A Command Line app allowing users to select dishes from a menu and place an order. Integrated with Twilio API to send confirmation texts. | 2-day solo project | Ruby, RSpec, Rubocop |


## Skills

#### Mission-driven 
As a founding member of the Gallery Climate Coalition - a charity formed during lockdown to develop a meaningful and industry-specific response to the growing climate crisis - I conducted research and attended board-meetings to deliver this [online resource](https://galleryclimatecoalition.org/) which includes a carbon-calculator tailored to the art world. This has enabled galleries to conduct a yearly carbon report and thus help them reduce the amount of carbon they use by 50% by 2030. It sparked my interest in how tech can solve problems.

In work and while learning, I am motivated by solutions that can make a difference. My idea for a community-focused football app (designed for players outside of the sport's traditionally male audience) was chosen and developed for the final engineering project at Makers. Seeing [KickAbout](https://github.com/lildann/kickabout) take shape from identifying a gap in the market, to being built into an online platform was really exciting. My experience working in creative industries gives me a unique perspective in approaching problems that coding can solve. 


#### Planning and Communication 
As the Exhibitions Manager for a fast-paced gallery with three locations in Central London, communication and building strong working relationships (internally across departments and externally with artists, suppliers, and clients) was key to the success of each exhibition. Being promoted consistently throughout my time there was the outcome of analysing and identifying areas for improvement and implementing new methods, such as departmental Trello Boards, and leading agenda-focused meetings, and bringing people together. 

For each of the group projects at Makers, the time we spent in the planning and design stages helped communication and productivity, keeping the team on track and completing the Minimum Viable Product. Using Agile processes - such as daily stand-ups and retros - also helped with motivation and general wellbeing. Since finishing the course at Makers, I have become a mentor to three students. Entering a new industry, I appreciate that it can feel daunting, and aim to give advice, encouragement and perspective to fully embrace the intensity of the course.  


#### Time Management and Attention to Detail
When working for an arts book publisher in Berlin, I proofread non-fiction texts in layout stages - this required a good eye for detail and the ability to work consistently and methodically when under a time-pressured print deadline. These skills have been helpful while at Makers, and I take pride in writing clear, well-crafted code. 

With the introduction of JavaScript in week 6 of the course, I initially struggled with the amount of material to cover. By planning my goals for the week, timeboxing my learning, and making time for reflection each day, I've learnt how to maximise productivity, which includes breaks, and get the most out of my learning.  


#### Problem Solving
Working with artists to interpret their vision and plan projects requires an operational skillset, which considers logistical details while maintaining perspective on the timeline and end result. The gallery is known for launching emerging artists' careers with ambitious projects - as the artist liaison for Alvaro Barrington, I coordinated his [collaboration with Notting Hill Carnival](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2019/09/27/throwing-open-the-gallery-doors-the-art-world-darlings-keeping-it-real) to decorate the Socaholic float with his paintings. 

Interpreting a brief and building a web app from start to finish is a fundamental aspect of coding that I enjoy. My organised, clear-sighted approach helps in debugging when closing the loop and finding the root cause of blockers. Makers has left me feeling ready to learn new tech stacks and take on new challenges.

## Interests

* I have an enduring interest in art and culture, and love going to museums and exhibitions to learn more about the world and challenge my perspective, most recently [Paula Rego's](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/paula-rego) socio-political portraits at Tate Britain.
* I enjoy playing football every week in the team I started with friends.
