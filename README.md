## About

Creative and organised full-stack developer. Recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) software engineering bootcamp. 

My background and career up until now has been focused on contemporary art. When the art world moved online as an outcome of the pandemic, most of this output sought only to reproduce the basic experience of viewing art through a screen. Interested in how this could be developed, the world of tech opened up through my research. Driven by curiosity and a desire to keep learning, coding has changed my focus, widened my perspective, and enabled me to switch from a facilitator to a maker. 

The skills I developed while building exhibitions - problem-solving, working to hard deadlines, and communicating with multiple stakeholders - paired with a habit of analysing structures to make them more efficient, are qualities that I bring to a team with energy and positivity. At Makers, I've learnt processes in line with best industry practices - I take pride in clean, test-driven code and value accessibility and user experience. Always seeking to look at the world in new ways, I'm motivated by the impact code can make on everyday life and I'm excited to work in an industry that can create solutions to the complex problems we currently face.


## Projects

The Makers course focused on pair programming, test driven development, Agile processes, and learning by doing. You can see my progression throughout the course on [Github](https://github.com/lildann?tab=repositories), and in these projects:
